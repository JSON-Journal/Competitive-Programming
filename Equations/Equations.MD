
##  1 ) Sum of Elements in a Subarray is Equivalent to Sum of (Elements − 1)

If a sum of every subarray for index $l$ to $r$ or $a_l + a_{l+1}+ …+ a_r$ is needed to be the as equivalent as their length which is below ,

$$
\sum_{i=l}^{r} a_i \;=\; r-l+1
$$

### Which is equivalent to the Equation of:

$$
\sum_{i=l}^{r} (a_i - 1) = 0
$$
